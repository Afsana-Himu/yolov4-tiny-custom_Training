# Training a custom detector for Object Detection using YOLOv4-tiny

## Mask detection using YOLOv4-tiny

The yolov4 folder contains all the 5 custom files needed. (i.e. obj.zip, yolov4-tiny-custom.cfg, obj.data, obj.names and process.py)

The **obj** folder contains 1370 images along with their YOLO labeled text files. These images are mostly close-up images. If you want to download more long range images, you can search for datasets online. I will be giving the links for collecting datasets at the bottom .

There are approximately 900 images for class **with_mask** and 400 images for class **without_mask**. You can add your own images and their YOLO labeled text files to it. Try to find good quality images.

The **yolov4-tiny-custom.cfg**, **obj.data**, and **obj.names** files are customized for the 2 classes I will be working with. (i.e. with_mask & without_mask)
